A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 
A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.

2 is the smallest prime number since it's factors are 2 and 1.
11 is a prime number since it's factors are 1 and 11.

But 4 is a composite number since it's factors are 1, 2, and 4.
