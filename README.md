## Armstrong Number

An integer is an Armstrong number is it is positive and the sum of each digit to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number.

For example, 153 has a number of 3 digits and the sum of the cubes of each digit is equal to 153.
  
  153 = 1**3 + 5**3 + 3**3  
  
153 is an armstrong number.

  32 = 3**2 + 2**2
  
32 is not an armstrong number.

Write a program that gets an input from the user and checks if the number is an armstrong number or not.
