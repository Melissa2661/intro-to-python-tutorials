This repository includes exercises for Introduction to Python workshops guided by Girls Who Code McGill. You can find the questions below. Please try to solve them by yourself before checking the answers ⭐️.

## Armstrong Number

An integer is an Armstrong number is it is positive and the sum of each digit to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number.

For example, 153 has a number of 3 digits and the sum of the cubes of each digit is equal to 153.
  
  153 = 1 ** 3 + 5 ** 3 + 3 ** 3  
  
153 is an armstrong number.

  32 = 3 ** 2 + 2 ** 2
  
32 is not an armstrong number.

Write a program that gets an input from the user and checks if the number is an armstrong number or not.


## Prime Number 

A prime number is a natural number greater than 1 that is not a product of two smaller natural numbers. 
A natural number greater than 1 that is not prime is called a composite number.

2 is the smallest prime number since it's factors are 2 and 1.
11 is a prime number since it's factors are 1 and 11.

But 4 is a composite number since it's factors are 1, 2, and 4.

Write a program that gets an input from the user and checks if the number is prime or not.

## Find Factors

Write a program that gets an input from the user and returns all factors of that number.

## Perfect Number

Write a program that gets an input from the user and checks if it is a perfect number or not.

In number theory, a perfect number is a positive integer that is equal to the sum of its positive divisors, excluding the number itself. For instance, 6 has divisors 1, 2 and 3, and 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, so 6 is a perfect number.

## Factorial

Write a program that gets an input from the user and returns the factorial.

## Fibonacci

Write a program that computes the fibonacci numbers up to 50 numbers.
